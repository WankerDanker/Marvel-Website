  <div class="tag1">Introduction </div>
  <p>“I am Iron Man”, “Wakanda Forever”, “With great power comes great responsibility”, these are the few of the quotes that comes from the most influential studio of all time, Marvel Studios. Marvel Studio was first a comic book publisher created by Martin Goodman in 1939 and after the massive success of Iron Man 1, Marvel Studios was established in 2009 and has become the most famous superhero studio in the world, creating an important aspect in modern popular culture. According to Forbes, after being Purchased for $4 billion, Disney’s superhero factory is now worth more than $50 billion.(Forbes). There are numerous reasons as to what helps Marvel Studios achieve such status. Ranging from giving little children inspiration models to the continuous expansion of  a cinematic universe, Marvel has a special position in today pop culutre.</p>
  <div class="tag1">The Inspiration  </div>
  <p>As a kid, who would not want to be a superhero; to imagine ourselves as the savior of the innocents and to fight off villains that threaten to destroy the world is the eternal dream of any child. Children are drawn to superheroes because they aspire to have extraordinary abilities, such as flight, super strength, and invulnerability, believing that these powers will fulfill their wildest dreams. At the same time, superheroes are children's role models because of their courage and determination. According to a New York Times article, during the second World War, families lived in constant fear of the Nazis. Using that fact, artist Jack Kirby created Captain America,  who fought Nazis while wearing a star-spangled costume, a true representation of America. Kirby wanted to create a character to make the powerless feel powerful, a beacon of light for those who felt helpless, who may have had family members in Europe (New York Times). Superheroes symbolizes what humans could never be, thus why they gave not only kids but sometimes adults hope to look forward to. Their tenacity in dark times, their bravery in the face of danger and their unwavering spirits make superheros the stars in the eyes of children. </p>

  <p>As technology grows, Marvel Studio was able to give life to those lifeless animated pages and turn those characters into something we can see moving and fighting. When children see their heroes on the screen fighting bad guys and rescuing the innocent, they feel like they could do it as well. According to CNN, a fascination with superheroes can benefit a child in many ways, including boosting his self-confidence and making him feel powerful (CNN). The image of a superhero diving headfirst into a danger to save those who are in need has slowly become a part of the popular culture; a damsel in distress or a child stuck in a burning building, screaming hopelessly as the superheroes ascend from the sky and save them. An image that we have all become fairly familiar with and that is what popular culture is. In the 2008 Iron Man, the audience was amazed by how Tony Stark landed into a village in Afghanistan to save its inhabitants from the Ten Rings Terrorist (Favreau). He had no fear, only fire in his heart. Furthermore,  2011 Captain America: The First Avenger features Steve Rogers charging head first into the enemy stronghold to rescue the captive prisoners (Johnston). These scenes have made Marvel characters a beacon of light and hope and solidified their positions in modern pop culture.</p>

  <div class="tag1">The Lessons </div>

  <p>The journey from comic book pages to the silver screen has been nothing short of extraordinary for Marvel Studios. The transition was not only a testament to the studio's adaptability but also a reflection of its visionary approach to storytelling. Marvel movies not only showcase eye-appealing,  action-packed scenes, they also teach incredible life lessons that everybody could relate to.</p>
  <p> In Sam Rami’s 2002 Spider Man, we follow a teenager called Peter Parker, who got bitten by a radioactive spider and gained superhuman strength as well as spider-like abilities. He built himself a suit and swung around New York as the friendly neighborhood protector (Raimi). As extraordinary as his story might sound, we could still see Peter Parker dealing with regular life problems such as going to school, doing homework, getting groceries ,etc. These images let the audience see that superheroes are just like anybody else, they still have earthly matters to care for. However, what separates them from us is their responsibilities to others. One of the most famous quotes that comes from Spider-Man and also an important piece of pop culture is the quote from Ben Parker, Peter Parker’s uncle, “With great power comes great responsibility.” This quote was meant for superheroes and regular people to live by. In a realistic view, as people achieve higher status in life, they have more responsibilities to care for those around them.</p>
  <p>Marvel movies have a lot of life messages that directors try to implement in the line of their characters.  Many of the famous quotes from these movies have gone down into modern media such as “I can do this all day” from Captain America, “We never lose out demons, Mordo. We only learn to live above them” from Doctor Strange '' and "You are the product of all who came before you, the legacy of your family” from Shang Chi (Saab). They are all important life lessons the audience can learn from and the overall incorporation of profound and memorable quotes from Marvel movies has permeated and contributed to a broader cultural dialogue on responsibility, perseverance, and the enduring struggle in life. In essence, Marvel Studios' storytelling has not only elevated the superhero genre but has also played a pivotal role in shaping the moral and ethical discourse within contemporary popular culture.</p>
  <div class="tag1">The Problems </div>
  <p>Furthermore, Marvel has gone out of their way to target more of current societal problems in their recent movies. Superheroes now have to balance between saving the world and saving their world. </p>
  <p>For instance, in the TV series The Falcon and The Winter Soldier, Sam Wilson-played by Anthony Mackie- struggled with upholding the mantle of Captain America and preventing the emergence of a super terrorist group. After the previous Captain America, Steve Rogers, gave Sam the famous star spangled shield with hope that he will succeed as the new owner. However, Sam faced racial discrimination from the very own people he has to protect. Even as a superhero who has saved the world from extraterrestrial threats such as Thanos, Sam still has to deal with his own dilemmas that are even more complicated. In another example, Bucky Barnes- played by Sebastian Stan- had to battle with PTSD from all his warring days while trying to help Sam to fit into his new role. The Winter Soldier used to be a feared assassin and a great fighter. He had been fighting beside Captain America ever since World War 2. Bucky had had to watch his friends die in battle without being able to do anything about it. There was a scene in the series where Bucky was finally freed from his traumas and he bursted into tears.</p>
  <p> Notice how these two heroes have battled the worst enemies of humanity but yet, they still have to face their own inside battle. According to an article by Medium.com, superheroes may wear capes and have superhuman powers, but at their core, they are just like us. They have vulnerabilities, fears, and doubts that we can all relate to (Zohvib).  Racism and battle traumas are very real things, anyone could go through them, even superheroes. Even the God of Thunder Thor has weakness and Marvel showed that really well.</p> 
    <p>By incorporating real-world problems into their narratives, Marvel has elevated the superhero genre from mere entertainment to a platform for reflection and discussion. This development not only adds layers to the characters but also resonates with audiences on a personal level, fostering empathy and connection. Marvel's willingness to delve into these themes highlight the studio's commitment to mirroring and addressing societal challenges, making their content not only entertaining but also culturally relevant. In doing so, Marvel movies have become a powerful mean for commentary, influencing conversations and perceptions within modern popular culture.</p>
